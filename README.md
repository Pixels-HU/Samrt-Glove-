## Description
Our project is Smart Glove turns sign language into speech, there are a big gap between deaf and dumb community and normal people our project aims to remove this gap. So, project helps deaf and dumb people by removing there communication barrier.
In our project we use Arduino and Various sensors are interfaced with a microcontroller which measures sensors values and according to the values measured quantitatively, coding has been done using Arduino C language and Arduino IDE.

# Circuit diagram
Here is screen shot for our circuit from Easy Eda our circuit contains shield for Arduino which connecting all our parts with the Arduino, the important thing is the MPU 6050 its should will constructed on the glove so the best way is to put on the shield then we makes parts of flex sensor connections with its voltage divider circuit with 50k ohm resistance and Finally the last part is the audio amplifier circuit which takes its input from Arduino and pass it to the speaker .

## CODE

The code divide into two parts:
First part is the main code
Second part is the initialization
